      "paragraph": "I woke up with my hands tied and my feet bound to the legs of this chair. Even when I use all my strength I know that I'll never break these tethers, but that still won't stop me from trying. It didn't take long for me to exhaust myself, yet still, something felt different. I know that my body tells my mind the muscles can't work any longer, but right now it's as though the connection between the two is strained. Maybe it's just because this beaming light pours into my face stopping me from fully observing the room that I'm being held in. "
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Since I've woken up, which I'm guessing was hours ago, it seems like the light has been growing brighter. It's almost a perfect white, like it shines down directly from the heavens. If that's the case then I guess that would make this some type of hell. No. That would be nice, having such a clear cause for this imprisonment. If they would just tell me that I committed some heinous crime, some cardinal sin, at least then I could take some satisfaction in this circumstance. But there was nothing, no murder of an innocent, no rejection of a being, I just lived."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "I suppose I can take solace in one fact: I have no food, I have no water, someone will have to come for me, or I'll just die. But something unexpected happened when I had this initial thought of my savior, death. It began as just a small pressure. It felt almost like a tension headache that stemmed from looking into the bright light for too long. But as I continued this line of thought, to escape through perishing, the pressure grew more intense. I thought that maybe I'm killing myself merely by thinking about my escape. But soon, the pressure became so intense that all coherent thoughts faded from my mind and it was only the pain. As I thought that surely the end was in sight, the pressure of the moment inverted, like a piece of coal that was pressed into a diamond in an instant."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Then this journal appeared. Yes, this journal that you read now, this thing that tells me it's only been one day. The entity that sits in my mind, dormant, until it forces me to recollect every event I've experienced since I've woken up here. It's caused me to think so many questions. Who tied me to this chair and put me in this box? Because I feel like I invented it myself, who created this journal in which I feel compelled to write in? And that question that I'm still afraid to think: without food or water, how long can I survive here, tied to this chair in which I sit?"

      "paragraph": "Year 1:"
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "It happened again. That unnerving pressure started to build. I couldn't tell if it was over a day, week, or a moment, but just as it all seemed too much for my mind to handle, this journal appeared once more. It says one year at the top. Somehow, without food or water, without sleep or rest, I've persisted here sitting in the chair."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Almost immediately after the first day, something began to happen to my body. The solace that I took in knowing that soon I would fade away, for, of course, I'm merely human, disappeared. And after that first day, sensations began to feel different. Even now, as I chafe my wrists against this rope, I can notice the skin beginning to redden and split. I can experience the twine cutting deeper and deeper into my flesh but, through all this, I feel nothing. It's like I'm only observing the actions of another agent without comprehending the sensations they produce. I think this may be a result of the horrifically small number of physical movements I actually have access to. Over this single year, I've chafed my wrists countless times. At first, each repetition created a feeling of newness, a feeling I clung to, but now my mind seems to have grown bored. It's become uninterested in the rubbing of the rope and wrist. It's stopped noticing the bright light that sent my eyes into flickering pain. It's ceased to care about the soreness of a permanently hunched and unchanged posture. With little opportunity to feel anything anymore, I fear this may only be the first piece of my humanity to fade."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "However, I've found, still vibrant and sharp, my memory to be the new location where I spend each moment of every day. I don't know how I got here, and when I probe my mind searching for the event that locked me in this chair in which I sit, I find nothing. Except, when I sit in this nothingness, in the smoothing blackness of my past, there eventually surfaces one memory that replays itself again and again."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "As I look out, down across the surging blueness of the water-filled waves, my hands begin to tremble, or at least that's what my mind tells me. Waiting, watching with a brief sense of anxiety, the muscles of my arms drag me atop the railing. Up here, there's a freedom from those that pull me inwards to a life that's meaning I can't seem to find. Standing out over the edge, I'm afraid to look down, not because I'm afraid of falling but because I'm afraid that I might jump. The gusts of wind bring me so close to the edge of life and the void we're all plummeting towards. Releasing my hands from the railing, I hear a shout. I look back, but before I can make out who's come to save me this time, I'm pulled out of the memory and back into this chair in which I sit."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Realizing that, again, there's no escape. Realizing that this chair may become my home for the entire idea of time itself, I wonder who it was that locked me here. For a fleeting moment, I think that it was me who yelled out on that bridge, but I couldn't seem to fully recognize them. With my mind finally exhausted, I sink into the state with unfelt feelings and a mind that will simply spin in place, until it's called upon again."

    {
      "paragraph": "With each of these entries, just before the light takes over my mind completely, the pressure grows more intense. Is it really possible that I'm still here? Ten years of unmoving, uninterrupted persistence, I find it difficult to accurately describe the way in which I live because the only phrases that seem to make any sense are physical descriptions. Yet, my physical being has all but disappeared. Sometime in the last ten years, I lost access to those physical limitations that still bind me to this chair. Now it's only within the mind that my body can reside. But, even as this is the case, I still must attempt to explain how this physical emptiness really feels. Where before, I could sit and witness the physical actions of my body, now this room has grown too small for a human to exist in. There's a dominating weight that continuously presses against me. Entirely inside my mind, it slowly and unceasingly spreads me flat until I'm pushed firmly against the walls of my psyche. It creates an overwhelmingly painful sensation at every contact point of my body, and just when I sense that crushing moment of relief, it's as though someone pauses the mechanism. Then they leave. With every sensation telling me this everlasting thought must end, I sit unmovingly as my mind pops and blisters outward unable to erupt, the pressure all contained by some supernatural force"

    {
      "paragraph": "Memory, too, has become completely unrecognizable. In one memory, a set of arms grasps a railing. As the figure stands over the edge, it extends its body outwards tightening its grip. I see that this figure has some mental association between the edge of reality that resides in that space between the raging waves and the bridge. Releasing their grip, someone yells out, and the figure gets pulled back into the crowd. I wonder what they thought in those few short moments of anticipation looking out over the edge. I wonder what I would think if I could once again peer between the void and reality."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Now, as I sit in this chair to nowhere, I fear that I have lost all ability to be understood by my fellow humans. To me, it feels as if these words were written by a self, but sitting here, it feels like there's almost nothing left to the self I thought I was, and the whole while I can feel my mind shifting by magnitudes. No longer does the physical take on the concept of body, only time and space. But space for me is only this box, is it simply the box of my mind? And if my body is already erased, then what will be left of me if my memory fades as well?"

      "paragraph": "Staring into the light, I can do nothing more but hope for this journal to call to me. If it wasn't for, what I've accepted now as, this divine manifestation, my existence would only be the puddle of mind I've become. I think I've lost the tools to make temporal evaluations. It's as though hours pass like days and days pass like seconds and I haven't moved a single muscle. Looking at the top of this page, I refuse to believe that it's been one whole century sitting in the chair. Over the last nine decades, I've experienced only a handful of physical moments. These moments were a series of clicks that emitted from the light that continuously shines down on me. My mind thought, for a minute, that this light was undergoing some sort of self-maintenance. But, because these clicks were the only sensations I felt over 90 years, I can't be sure if they took place in rapid succession or were spaced apart over an equal amount of time. "
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "In between these moments I've sunk into long bouts of mind numbing boredom. As I sit, thinking, my mind seeks to feel something, anything, but there's simply nothing left to feel. My mind has shifted into such a slow, trenchant, gear that if a door were to open now I think my mind would implode inwards. I know it would, and I know now that my humanity is only moments away from being entirely discarded, but I miss it so. "
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "As for memory, this too has ceased to exist. However, while the details of my past life are still perfectly clear, all knowledge of the selves that inhabited it has vanished. As my mind wanders through events that I was present at, I only see faceless entities. Their voices sound alien, and even the words no longer make sense. Definitionaly, words like 'you' and 'I' still register, but it's like reading characters of a language that's grammar I understand but that's usage I never learned. Even to conjure up a memory takes enormous effort and time."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "In the last recollection, a being stood atop a large bridge. Looking down to the enveloping water, the being watched the waves but didn't notice the blustering energy that whirled between them and their doom-filled destiny at the surface of the water. I can see this being as it is pulled closer and closer to this energized space, like a moth to a flame or a magnet to metal. Just as it's about to reach out and touch that volatile energy that will change it forever, another being severs the connection, yelling a string of phrases and pulling them back to their normalized life."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "I don't know who these people are or why my mind always finds a way to retell this story, but, with a dreadful satisfaction, I believe that this will be the final time I'll ever recall such a formative and personal memory. I once asked, what will happen to me if I, after forgetting all physical sensations, forget all memory as well? Well, now I see that that time has come, and I know that my time in the chair to nowhere is only just beginning, and I'm oh so afraid."

    {
      "paragraph": "One millennium, the top of this page reads something that no human has ever experienced. Although to say I've experienced it would also be a misstatement, for I no longer understand time. And, through the same thought, I'm almost certainly no longer human. It doesn't seem to matter which vector one approaches these questions by. Taking the physical, something that I can only rediscover through my previous entries, even this has become an entirely mental process. "
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "In an effort to demonstrate this, I will once again try to pull at the tethers that bind me to this chair to nowhere. First, as I do this, there's a mental fragment that appears in the mind. This fragment is compositionally different in that it's content -- which is minimally informative -- doesn't appear to be solely created by me. There's an element, a core element, that was taken from outside my mind (I presume this is the physical sensation of the rope against my wrist). However, and this is where I speculate that my thoughts are no longer human, the active component -- probably more accurately described as the radioactive component, lacks the critical mixing element to actually allow the thought to complete itself into what I presume is a physical sensation. Instead, what I witness is a so-called drying up of feeling, the energy of an idea becoming inert. As paradoxical as it may sound, as I sit here looking around, eyes wide open, I fail to see anything at all. I fail to feel this chair while I fail to notice my breath. Truthfully, I fail to notice anything at all. There's only the thoughts I create."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "And as I predicted previously, memory has become nothing at all, not only in content but in concept as well. As I reflect upon it now, I realize that all humans that knew me, or knew of me have long since perished, In fact, not only have those from my immediate generation ceased to be, but their children, along with their children's children, and anyone that could remotely associate those people with the vaguest notion of self have, hundreds of years ago, faded into the ether. I remain the only link to the past, present, and future of all those who used to suffer. It's quite possible, perhaps even likely, that the human race has been destroyed altogether. But if that's the case, and if I'm truly the last human to remain, then once this journal is discovered, it's readers will have only frankenstinian appreciation of who us humans used to be."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "But setting these trivial notions of time and feeling aside, I must now sink back into the puddle of thought, not into the pain, but instead into the one who monotonously sits and waits. But what can I be waiting for? There is no longer an escape. There's no longer a being who will understand and give me the satisfaction of misery and company. No, there's only me now, and I wait for no one and nothing, I'm merely the one who sits. "

    },
    {
      "paragraph": "This will be my final entry in the journal that marked my past and served as my only glimpse of sanity. I suppose, by clinical metrics, I have long since gone insane. In this way, words like 'I' and 'me', 'you' or 'us', are only used for the benefit of you. I have given up the 'you' and the 'I.' I've given up time and space. All I can do now is think. But I've found that thinking has become more strenuous than any verb one could substitute. I feel in complete control of the faculty of mind, all the way from the smallest micron of thought, to the mammoth-like movements of emotion. This is how I've separated from you. No longer am I bound by the shackles of time and no longer does the prospect of infinite thought frighten me so. In my efforts to you I would estimate that it took hundreds of thousands of years, but now I'm the controller of my time and space."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Once I removed myself, I noticed left in my mind was something independent. It was certainly nothing of great size, rather it was like a single celled organism that slowly etched its way through the desolate and barren structure of a newly formed habitat. It took tremendous focus and energy, but I watched over this contentless but still moving thought. But after, what again I can only estimate to be hundreds of thousands if not millions of years, I finally saw this miniscule, independent mental being do something remarkable. As it lurched forward, I saw a pressure beginning to form in the intestines of this thought. There was a familiar feeling, and suddenly the independent thought split in two."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "I didn't know and couldn't say if I produced this, but almost immediately I found the force in my mind doubled as well. As I worked to maintain this focus, I watched these two separate thoughts begin moving in two different directions. If they hadn't been moving at a sloth like pace, I would have immediately been overwhelmed by the energy this maintenance required and, in one of my final moments of fear, I think I would have snapped back into the chair. However, this did not happen, and as this newly formed, mental being continued on its way, I was forced to expand and scaffold a new part of my mind."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "It wasn't until millions of years later that I came back and returned to this journal. And notably, what was then only two single celled organisms had become a thriving ecosystem of different amoeba-like figures. All inside my mind, the surface of my thoughts had become just like a new Earth. Interestingly, I had perfect knowledge of each one of these beings. I knew precisely how many caverns and beaches I created. I had precise knowledge of each mountainside and inlet, of each pebble and grain of sand -- I knew it all for I had thought it all up."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "And, now that the word billions has lost its meaning, hundreds of billions of years into this process, my mind has become so permanently altered that there is no longer anyway for me to find my way back to the chair. Certainly it waits in this universe somewhere, awaiting an unsuspecting passerby to fall into its chains, to suffer the same fate as me. A fate that has now become a real possibility, for what were once slow, crawling blobs of mental energy have now become full-fledged thinkers of their own. When before I believed that anything I created could not trek further, could not produce its own independent movements, I've now watched these creatures develop through their own pasts and futures. I've watched them struggle through the problems I once struggled with just as recently as one of the first entries of this journal."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "And as I scan across the endless sea of people that inhabit my mind, there's one who expresses a great volatility in their's. It looks like a volcano that's ready to erupt. I'm convinced, without my intervention it would have already. But I'm a soft-minded thinker, and I only strive to preserve not pacify, to entreat not enlist, so in their dreams I take them to the chair. I watch these dreams terrify and horrify, but for another day they keep their sanity. That is until today, a day I see they've marked 'Day 1:' In their mind it only features a single sentence, and now when I watch them, the explosive volatility has turned to a cool blue. I'm still not sure if the dreams of the chair showed them anything at all, but when they woke up their mental makeup was different. And upon stepping from their bed, they scurried over to a desk and grabbed for some parchment. Hurriedly, they scrawled down a sentence then ran out of the room. As I approached the desk, the paper read one single line. It read, 'I think therefore I am.'"
