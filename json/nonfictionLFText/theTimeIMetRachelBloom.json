How can a stranger take from me my appetite that I so rarely find. It's goddamn 6:08 in the morning and you want to chat with a stranger? Can't you see my express disinterest telling that I do not want to talk to you for even a single moment. Good god please do not bring your chair closer to mine, please do not unload your pathetic ego unto me. I have no use for your delusions of grandeur. I have no use for your ambitions inspired by the post-credit that you hope to or have already received. The mere fact that you impress yourself upon me tells me all I need to know. "

I thought that reflective and regretful moment would come much later, but now I'm realizing this moment has already arrived. Clearly, I have discovered an instance of mental disjunction and my first instinct was to debase and demean this person (not to their face but to their essence no doubt)."
