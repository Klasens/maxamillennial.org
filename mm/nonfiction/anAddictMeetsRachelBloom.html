      <p class="text">Stop! Watch!</p>
      
      <p class="text">The addict has spotted the thief, and now theyâ€™ve become engaged in a battle for existence.</p>
      
      <p class="text">&#39;You know what I do when people are attacking me with negative energy? I walk away.&#39; This the addict seemed to shout, and at the same time, seemed to foreshadow his eventual action. </p>
      
      <p class="text">In this particular instance one can witness so clearly what theyâ€™re battling over but no.</p>
      
      <p class="text">The scene before almost feels like a fever dream.</p>
      
      <p class="text">Sitting in the deep corner, me, the contemplator, watches with muted ear buds all the interactions of those who sit in front of me. Immediately in front, who might be the unluckiest man of the morning, the addict verbally confronts him with casual conversation as he works. He attempts to fix the table beside me, but also must explain, outrageously so, his hebrew texted tattoo, his life story, and his technical profession to the addict, sitting at the table directly his flank, who is addicted to stealing people&#39;s time. Is it only time he steals? Is it life force or life motivation? His friendly demeanor is instantly betrayed by his desperation to feel the future of what the others strive to feel. Itâ€™s been taken from him, too smart for his own good. Maybe smart is a mundane descriptor here, too self-aware for his own good, too lacking in self-definition for his own good. This a particularly dangerous affair, having a tremendous awareness of the self while having no self to define.</p>
      
      <p class="text">If the addict wasnâ€™t enough, the thief, the woman who steals inspiration, engages this deadly orgy. She sits directly to the fixers front. Sandwiched by two extremes, the man tries to work and is barraged by questions and nonsensical phrases that come from the thief. Sheâ€™s nearly incoherent, chiming in with phrases such as, &#39;How did my notebook get so wet?&#39; She appears to be saying it to no one, but because of the good nature of the table fixer, he looks up acknowledging that, at least, she exists. This causes the addict, who is forced to mirror the moods and reactions of those around him, to give this acknowledgement as well.</p>
      
      <p class="text">I do not give such an acknowledgement. I type feverishly. I capture and record their souls because they, with such casualness and naviety, display them before me. Plus, I know that if I look up for even a moment, the thief and addict will notice my existence and strong arm their way into my mind. This I cannot allow, for Iâ€™ve already allowed it once.</p>
      
      <p class="text">Just to prove the point Iâ€™ve made above, in the span of typing these paragraphs, through the corners of my gaze, Iâ€™ve captured 3-5 glances from the addict and 4-7 glances from the thief! So desparately they stare. I can feel the penetrating looks slide over my skin, into my mind and past for, they speculate but do not know that I am hyper engaged in my work. But with an irony I relish in over and over again, they are my work. They are who I must disambiguate into the pieces.</p>
      
      <p class="text">I thought one paragraph would be enough to demonstrate just how difficult a simple, meager, silent existence can be in the presence of these characters, but in only the past two minutes, the addict has walked past my table 3 times with a sidelong glance! I must maintain my focus otherwise he will pounce on my inaction and steal this page I type before you. You may think that theyâ€™ve stolen it already, but we still exist, here, just on the other side of the line, just within my locus of control. Iâ€™d like to get up and refill my coffee, but these characters swarm, truly, and cut of any angle of maneuver. For now I wait, entrenched, picking my moment to strike.</p>
      
      <p class="text">Finally, Iâ€™ve made it back to my corner, my contemplative fortress, and, I know as of now not much has been said of the thief that, on a past occasion, has also stolen a page from me. And, to prove mine and her character, right now, two tables in front of me, a poor bystander is losing his morning to the thief this very moment. He must have given her a glance, and now she sits telling the poor man of her screenplay! Why not write! Put down what you tell this person! But of course, this is not what interests her, this is not why she writes, she writes to steal, she writes so that she can do this and sit with other people and take their time.</p>
      
      <p class="text">&#39;Iâ€™ve got to send a couple emails. It was nice talking to you.&#39; This the poor man says, politely I should add.</p>
      
      <p class="text">But the thief, right to her character, hears nothing and simply says, &#39;I didnâ€™t like the screenplay.&#39; And she continues her stupid fucking rant about her screenplay that no one cares about, especially the poor man. I wish I could intervene on his behalf, and tell the woman to fuck right off because the man has &#39;emails to send&#39; but I must witness his attempt at escape.</p>
      
      <p class="text">Finally, she has left him, she&#39;s returned back to her chair, and with feverishness I continue to watch the addict. The addict as a title is especially fitting, not only because he is addicted to the aspirations and dreams of others, but because, as he explained to me on a past occasion, heâ€™s literally addicted to a number of substances and behaviors. This is evident by his behavior in the single hour heâ€™s spent here this morning. In the single hour, heâ€™s changed his position in the shop three different times. Heâ€™s spent half the hour walking around the coffee shop, and on each walk he would adjust and settle the chairs around him as if they were askew and out of place. Then only a few minutes later he would get up, complete another lap, and tend to the chairs that had not been moved since the last time he saw them</p>
      
      <p class="text">Now Iâ€™m beginning to feel exhaustion. Watching an addict try to live vicariously off the stolen lives from the thief creates some sort of black hole of identity. They speak about their childhoods to each other, each trying to one up the other in the disparate and unfortunate consequences that have surface throughout their lives. But, I must continue on, even when the essence of these individuals, and the truth of their actions has long since been captured, I must sit and watch and measure their behavior.</p>
      
      <p class="text">I get the impression that there is an unreal quality to this last occasion. How is it possible that, on two previous instances Iâ€™ve written pages about these two characters, and now, on this mornng they both exhibit the same behavior I catalogged previously. However, thereâ€™s no time for this thoughtful musing as, yet again, for the 4th time in the single hour Iâ€™ve been here, she has attacked another stranger. She has identified her pray and attempted to steal meaning from them.</p>
      
      <p class="text">This time she walks up to a, what I thought was, an old man with a large green overcoat and matching safari-like hat, but as Iâ€™ve watched the thief speak to him, and in one of the green manâ€™s escape attempts, I see that that itâ€™s actually a young man. This seems to be the thiefâ€™s pray, she always identifies the people who, due to their lack of experience, a lack of experience that I had only weeks ago, wonâ€™t immediately reject her intrusion onto their space. Theyâ€™ll reject her, but only after an extended period of time.</p>
      
      <p class="text">As some sort of refrain to her past self, the Rachel Bloom that caused me an irrational type of rage, she begins to laugh to herself. She, the &#39;comedy writer&#39; that she introduces herself as, sits laughing, almost manically, definitely strangely, so that those around herhave to wonder what the fuck is going on behind me.</p>
      
      <p class="text">I would like to take a moment and observe an unchanging part of this scene. So far, Iâ€™ve defined our crew as a group of six. What started out with four, me, the thief, the addict, and the table fixer, has now added the poor man, and the pseudo-old one. There is one part of the scene that deserves special note, but that note will have to wait, for somehow yet again, even after the polite declining of her existence, she has intruded once again on the poor manâ€™s space. Except this time, she comes across so clearly as one of the delusion that he tries not even to look up. Only upon being directly addressed with the statement, &#39;I write comedy on twitter, itâ€™s so funny,&#39; does the man give her a single look and the single word, &#39;Yea.&#39;</p>
      
      <p class="text">Still she laughs, laughing away, alone in a coffee shop with so many people around, but no one to listen, she laughs.</p>
      
      <p class="text">With my dreadful exhaustion mounting, a lul in the action takes place. The thief, this woman, has finally been placated by her ipad. It reminds me, quite distinctly, of a toddler whoâ€™s fully distracted by the piece of technology in front of them. As for Paul, our addict, I wish I had had time to mention, as the thief assaulted the room with her laughter Paul was, with a comedic irony, discreetly running and jumping outside of the cafe. For brief context, he, in his 5th move, had switched his seat to the outside portion of the cafe, and as he did this, his physically addicted tendencies forced him to jump and pace quickly. I donâ€™t think anyone noticed this but as he did this over the solitary laughter of the woman, it created an actual scene of comedy.</p>
      
      <p class="text">But now, let me return to the other rock that has existed in this scene. Of course, we have me, the catalogger, the contemplator, the identifier of their identities, but, only a few meters off to the side, there sits another individual. I surely doubt heâ€™s at all interested in the scene heâ€™s been a part of, but, if one were to make only a momentary, sighted observation, he could appear to fill the same role as me. Heâ€™s an older gentleman, balding, wearing a green shirt with blue earbuds in and, because Iâ€™ve been watching him long enough, he appears to be reading. The question, the burning question that rises from this scene, is why do the theif and the addict make no effort to steal and latch from this man. Is it because heâ€™s quite old, and the addict, being sexually interested in young men, canâ€™t be bothered by such a soul? Or is it because, the thief knows that this man would simply take none of her bullshit and, from only a momentary look, one can see he has absolutely no interest in the entire situation. I can quite confidently imagine that, if I were to approach the man, and ask him to appraise the last few hours as I have, he would say, &#39;What are you talking about? I havenâ€™t noticed anything.&#39;</p>
      
      <p class="text">However, I strikingly doubt that, if I were to approach the poor man, who has a great interest in the &#39;emails&#39; he sends, he would say anything of the same sort. I think Iâ€™d like to approach the man and ask him a single question. Iâ€™d like to preface it by saying, &#39;Listen, I donâ€™t want to waste any more of your time as I know that a chunk of it has already been wasted this morning. Itâ€™s just that, Iâ€™ve been sitting in the corner over there all morning and watched as that woman struck up conversation with you even though it was quite obvious that you had no interest. I watched as you told the woman you were busy and she ignored your statements and continued impressing herself upon you. I saw this and wanted to ask you one thing. What was the feeling you felt as she did this? Because, to give full disclosure, sheâ€™s done the same exact thing to me. She, a few months ago, approached me and out of courtesy I conversed and then nearly the same situation unfolded. It caused me great irritation. And, Iâ€™m sorry to impose, but I just wanted to know, if you were to characterize that feeling in a single word, what would it be? Awkward? Confused? Irritated? Enraged? Is there anything that comes to mind?&#39;</p>
      
      <p class="text">And as I approached the man, with intense subservience, and repeated the thoughts I just unveiled to you all, the poor man said, &#39;Just one word, I guess, sure, confusion.&#39; </p>
      
      <p class="text">Unfortunately, I only have access to the poor manâ€™s back, but as I observe only this he seems to have a standard look to him. He wears a black, plain baseball cap. His shirt, that covers the body of a man of roughly 8 past 20, is a deep teal mixed with the color of swamp-like water. Itâ€™s not a particularly elegant description, but the man has a pleasant flattery to him. He sits infront of a small laptop and mug of coffee signalling his chosen, minimal impact on the world around him. This stands in coarse opposition to those that sit near him, but I canâ€™t help but feel eased by the mood that exists in this poor manâ€™s small, cubed presence.</p>
