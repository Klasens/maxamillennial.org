        I've contracted the plague. This plague is not a fierce ailment of the
        body. It's not a brief snatching of life in a moment of agony or pain.
        It's worse than a simple, pleasurable second of bodily undoing. The
        plague I've contracted is a creeping destruction of the mind. It's an
        oozing crushing, a slow, methodical unraveling, an impossible to escape,
        leaving no survivors behind, force of domination. It's a pestilence that
        sweeps everything in its wake leaving a desolate landscape of sameness
        and death.

        I wondered if a diagnosis of impending doom would change our life.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        It changed mine. Except it didn't change it into one of poetic,
        cathartic experience. Instead, it simply forced me to observe its
        frivolousness.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        As we fade from view and refuse to accept it, one sees there is no cure,
        and yet I probe every facet of my life.
