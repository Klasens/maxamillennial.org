        It wasn't until the later stages where the feelings actually became
        characterizable. I still, somehow, recall that first feeling of a
        blissful answer. It's something I can't stop reaching for.
      </p>

        As the child lay there in his bed, he pondered the first question all
        people ponder. He lay there clutching his mind and wondering about those
        questions which he, for the first time, realized existed. What was then
        only a feeling is now understood as the thing it is: a wrenching
        paralysis, a pain borne of the mind.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The child tried the standard fixes. The first, being nothing less than a
        wholesome attempt, only covered the wound for about 24 hours. What's
        still vexing to the adult he has become is his observation that some
        people can discover that fearful question, apply the same simple
        solution he did, and have it stick for the rest of their life. And such
        a slavely application it was!
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        I know there are some of you who, in this moment, are feeling that
        anxious dread and would like me to at least outline this possible
        solution. You might like to try it for any reprieve, for the relief of a
        single day (perhaps, if you're especially anxious), an hour, or even
        minute would be preferred to the emptiness you feel now â€” even if it's a
        solution manufactured by the great peddlers and charlatans of history. I
        can, with great anxiety myself, confirm that there is no solution. Those
        questions you have will never be answered (not the way you'd like them
        to be). But in any case, against my better judgement, I will devote a
        single line to the solution which I found to be unsatisfying almost as
        quickly as I considered it.
      </p>

        "We couldn't have just appeared here, someone had to create us, or at
        least start the universe."

        Oh, by the way, I got a coffee today and had the most interesting
        conversation with a barista.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        "Yes I'd like a medium coffee please. Why, you ask? Because the death of
        the universe is only moments away, the inevitable stripping of meaning
        just one sip further, the undeniable triviality exactly one thought
        closer."
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        I continued to live, but the cycle would repeat: approach the new
        mountain top, observe the great potential of the horizon, then descend
        back down lower than ever before.
